                I am a pharmacist technician for CVS living in the Harrisburg area, working to become a web developper. 
                In high school I took a very brief web development course, though it was taught through a program.
                It didn't teach us to actually code, but it was more a design course. It was one of my favorite classes at the time.
                Web development gave me a way to be both technical and creative, which I enjoyed greatly.

                In the first part of 2020 I am trying to finally learn to do web development from start to finish.
                I don't just want to be able to design a website but want to know how to build it. 
                Despite work demenanding much of my time with the 2020 Covid situation, I am still trying to find time for class.
                I hope to be able to continue to learn to code and work on new projects as the weeks go on.
